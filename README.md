# Visualizing-and-Clustering-Customer-Data-Using-Self-Organizing-Maps

n today's world, businesses must have a good understanding of their customers' preferences and behaviors to provide better products and services. One way to do this is to use data analytics to gain insights from customer data. In this article, we will explore how to analyze customer data using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. We will use customer data from a shopping mall to demonstrate how SOMs can help us identify customer segments based on their spending patterns.

First, we will start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the customer data from a CSV file. We will then explore the data using various visualization techniques. We use SparkSession to create a Spark session and read in the CSV file as a Spark DataFrame. We also convert the Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame df_vs for visualization purposes.

Next, we create a correlation matrix to see if there is any relationship between the features. We use sns.heatmap() to visualize the correlation matrix. We also use sns.lmplot() to visualize the relationship between Annual Income and Spending Score. Additionally, we use plt.hist() and df_vs['Gender'].value_counts().plot() to visualize the distribution of Age and Gender in the dataset, respectively. We also use df_vs.boxplot() to visualize the Spending Score distribution by Gender. Lastly, we group the Age into six groups and use sns.violinplot() to visualize the Spending Score distribution by Age Group.

Now that we have explored the data, we can begin clustering using SOMs. First, we select the relevant features and convert the Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame. Then, we use VectorAssembler and StandardScaler to prepare the data for clustering. We create a pipeline to apply these transformations to the data and fit the pipeline to the data.

Next, we train the SOM with the scaled data. We use MiniSom to create a 10x10 SOM with a Gaussian neighborhood function. We then assign each data point to its nearest SOM neuron and add the cluster labels to the Pandas DataFrame.

Finally, we visualize the SOM using different techniques. We use plt.pcolor() to visualize the SOM weights and plt.scatter() to visualize the data distribution in the SOM clusters. We also use som.get_weights() to obtain the mean feature values of each cluster and visualize them using plt.imshow().

In conclusion, SOMs can be a powerful tool for identifying customer segments based on their spending patterns. By clustering customers into different groups, businesses can tailor their products and services to meet the needs of each group. Through visualization techniques, we can gain insights from customer data and make informed decisions that can help businesses grow and succeed.
